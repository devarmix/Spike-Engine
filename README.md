## About The Project

Spike Engine is my hobby side project which was in development since autumn of 2024. 
Its not production ready and still misses lots of features, but im open to suggestions on how i can improve it.

## Building

For now engine only supports windows and xbox support is planned in the far future, no other platforms are planned tho. 
To build u need a Visual Studio 2022 and installed a latest Vulkan 1.3 SDK on your pc.
ALso a GPU with support for Vulkan 1.3 and required extension is needed.
Project is using Premake build system.

1) Git clone the project or download it as zip.
2) Run GenerateProjects.bat file.
3) Open the generated SpikeEngine.sln

## Warning!

Project for now uses resources, that are not commited on github cause of their size.
If u wanna to try the project in its current state either contact me or change all paths that lead to resources in the code to yours.
